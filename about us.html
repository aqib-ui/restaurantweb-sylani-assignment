                  giving your promotional materials a
                  facelift, it’s important to include a restaurant mission statement. Your restaurant is an extension of
                  yourself and the values that you live by, and communicating that to your guests can help them
                  understand
                  your restaurant and turn them into more loyal customers. Understanding your mission more also helps

                <p class="whe">Before you get started, take time to brainstorm what your restaurant means to you. Why
                  did you open it?
                  What beliefs impact your decision making?

                  Next, research how other restaurants communicate their mission and vision. You’ll see that some
                  restaurants have long stories, while some are short and concise sentences. As you write yours, write a
                  statement that reflects you and stays true to your restaurant’s branding.

                  For restaurants, having strong value, vision, mission and culture statements is essential for ensuring
                  a
                  strong business integrity. But first, do you understand what it truly means to have a restaurant

                <p>Your values define the decisions you make and the people whom you work with. For that reason, your
                  value statement should be defined before moving onto any other statement or idea.

                  When getting started on your value statement, it might help to list out a few of your competitive
                  traits. What sets you apart? Why should people buy from you?

                  Try not to explain what your restaurant does or what you’re planning for the future in this statement,
                  as that will be explored in your vision and mission. Instead, your value statement should be a
                  succinct, powerful explanation of what your company believes in.</p>

          <p>Once you’ve defined your value statement, you can move onto your vision statement. Your vision is all about
            why your restaurant concept matters, and how it can influence people and the larger community around it.

            One way to hone in on your vision statement is to think about it as the “what” portion of your restaurant’s
            goals. What are you aspiring to do? How does this vision set you apart from your competitors? It might help
            to think back to your original motivations for opening the restaurant. Think about what you imagined for
            your concept, and what that might mean to other people.</p>

          <p>If your vision statement is the how behind your restaurant, then your mission is the what. Essentially,
            your mission details how you’re going to make your goals and dreams a reality.

            Perhaps your vision is to bring authentic French food to rural Ohio – but your mission details how you’ll
            achieve that vision through affordable prices and a traveling food truck.

            Mission statements for a restaurant can span a few sentences, but they are usually short and sweet. In fact,
            some of the most famous restaurant mission statements are just a few words.

            The best restaurant mission statements cater to the desires of the audience, yet are honest about what the
            restaurant is trying to accomplish..</p>
